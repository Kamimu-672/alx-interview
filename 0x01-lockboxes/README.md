Lockboxes Problem
This repository tackles the classic lockboxes problem. Imagine you have a sequence of locked boxes, each potentially containing keys to unlock other boxes, including itself. The first box is assumed to be unlocked.

The Challenge

The objective is to determine if all boxes can be eventually opened using the available keys.

Solution Approach

Our solution employs an iterative approach to explore the possibilities:

Tracking Opened Boxes: We'll maintain a list (or set) to keep track of the boxes that have been successfully opened so far. Initially, only the first box is marked as opened.
Iterating Through Boxes: We'll systematically go through each box in the sequence.
Unlocking with Keys: For each box, we'll examine the keys it contains. If a key points to an unopened box, we'll add that box to the list of opened boxes, signifying that it can be unlocked.
Checking All Opened: After processing all boxes and their keys, we'll verify if the list (or set) of opened boxes contains all box numbers from 0 to the total number of boxes minus 1.
If all boxes are present in the list, it means all boxes can be opened, and the function returns True.
If any boxes are missing, it signifies that some boxes remain unopened due to lack of keys, and the function returns False.
Key Points

The solution efficiently tracks opened boxes using a data structure like a list or set.
Iterating through boxes and their keys ensures all potential unlocking scenarios are considered.
The final check on the opened boxes list accurately determines if all boxes were eventually opened.
